When running protractor tests make sure you run a 'npm run webdriver' to make sure a selenium server is running before running the tests. And you will also have to run the server so go out of app and cd into server and type 'npm start' to start the server as well. After you have done this then you can type 'npm run protractor' to go through the tests.
